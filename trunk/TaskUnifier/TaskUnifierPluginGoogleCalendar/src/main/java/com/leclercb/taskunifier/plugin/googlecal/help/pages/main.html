		<p>The Google Calendar plugin will create two types of events: due date events and start date events.<br />
		You can configure the color of these events in the configuration panel.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Due date events:</dt>
			<dd>
				Each "due date" event represent a task with a due date.<br />
				The event start date is the due date of the task minus its length.<br />
				The event end date is the due date of the task.<br />
				<u>If the length is less than 30mn, a length of 30mn is used to display the event.</u><br />
				<br />
				If you do not use due time (use due time setting is disabled), the day end setting will be used as due time.<br />
			</dd>
			<dt>Start date events:</dt>
			<dd>
				Each "start date" event represent a task with a start date.<br />
				The event start date is the start date of the task.<br />
				The event end date is the start date of the task plus its length.<br />
				<u>If the length is less than 30mn, a length of 30mn is used to display the event.</u><br />
				<br />
				If you do not use start time (use start time setting is disabled), the day start setting will be used as start time.<br />
